# PhantomKit: Unofficial Swift SDK for Ghost API ðŸ‘»

PhantomKit is an unofficial Swift SDK for the Ghost Content API to interact with Ghost blogs, allowing you to fetch posts, pages (soon), tags (soon) and authors (soon) detail. I was learning about Phantom Types in Swift when learning about the Ghost Content API, and that is how I came with the name PhantomKit.

## Features

- One line Swift methods for the Ghost Content API using Swift concurrency
- Built for Swift 6.0 and compatible with iOS 16+, macOS 13+, tvOS 16+, watchOS 9+, and visionOS 1+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

You can add PhantomKit to your project using Swift Package Manager. Add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/rryam/PhantomKit.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Or add it directly in Xcode using File > Add Packages and enter the repository URL.

## Usage

Import PhantomKit in your Swift file:

```swift
import PhantomKit
```

Then, create an instance of `PhantomKit` with your Ghost site's admin domain and Content API key:

```swift
let phantomKit = PhantomKit(
    adminDomain: "your-site.ghost.io",
    apiKey: "your-content-api-key"
)
```

### Fetching Posts

To fetch posts from your Ghost blog:

```swift
do {
    let postsResponse = try await phantomKit.getPosts(limit: 15, page: 1)
    for post in postsResponse.posts {
        print(post.title)
    }
} catch {
    print("Error fetching posts: \(error)")
}
```
